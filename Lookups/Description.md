# Lookup Tables of LDhat

This folder contains a ZIP file of several lookup-tables necessary for the computation of **LDJump**. 
These files differ in sample sizes and theta. The path of the lookup tables is set as 

    /pathToLDhat/lk_files/"lk_n${nn}_t${th}_rh100_npts201.txt,
    
with ${nn} and ${th} being the sample size and value of theta. Therefore, self-computed lookup tables should be renamed as provided above and calculated with a rho of 100 and 201 points in the grid.
